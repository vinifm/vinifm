### Hey there! 👋

I'm Vinícius - or Vini, for short! I first started pursuing education in cinema and visual arts up until finally discovering a passion for programming along the way. I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of art and technology, especially how they intricately weave into the fabric of our daily lives, even in the subtlest of ways.
