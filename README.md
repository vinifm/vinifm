### Hey there! üëã

I'm Vin√≠cius - or Vini, for short! I first started pursuing education in cinema and visual arts up until finally discovering a passion for programming along the way. I'm quite captivated by how projects develop gradually and gain complexity over time, much like piecing together a puzzle with continuous new perspectives.
